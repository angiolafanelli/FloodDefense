about=Plugin for the Defense urban city from fludding
      
      The Flood Defense Toolkit Method (FDTM) is a planning
  instrument aimed at providing a general evaluation of the
  feasibility of a protection strategy against flooding for an 
  urban area. Such strategy may include different kinds of 
  technical and technological solutions and their mutual 
  combinations which are site specific.

  It has been developed as a QGIS plugin. It is based on a 
  limited set of easily available data (DTM, buildings and 
  streets map, land use, flooding map, etc.) and it guides the 
  user through the design of protected areas and perimeters to 
  which different kind of technical solutions can be assigned.

  The plugin includes also a set of elements for a preliminary 
  evaluation of rainwater management within the protected 
  areas and perimeters. 
 
  All the data are collected and ordered within a single 
  project file which can be used as a base for a collaborative 
  design process.
  The plugin allows to print a report containing a key-map and 
  tables with project data which can be used to easily compare 
  different intervention strategies.
  At the moment the manual is in italian. English version will
  be available soon.
